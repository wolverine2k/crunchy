# Introduction #

This is the front page for the Crunchy wiki, feel free to contribute and please try to keep this page as up-to-date as possible.

# End-User Documentation #

What precious little user documentation there is here is all contained in the GettingStarted guide.

# Current Development Documentation #

OK, there isn't any, but we really need to write some.

# The Comet Branch #

The Comet branch is an experimental rewrite of the Crunchy core, which aims to modularise the code and give Crunchy a huge speed boost. At the moment there are a few bits of (somewhat deprecated) information on it:

  * [CrunchyPluginAPI](CrunchyPluginAPI.md)
  * CrunchyPluginTutorial
  * CrunchyCommunication

# Other Stuff #

There are of course a number of other pages sitting around here, some more relevant than others:
  * ThirdPartyApplications - Third party applications in some way relevant to Crunchy.
  * [Examples](Examples.md) - ideas for tutorials using Crunchy.
  * SummerOfCodeIdeas - some suggestions for the Summer of Code 2007.
