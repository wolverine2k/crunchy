a place to suggest and submit code examples for crunchy to use.

# Introduction #
This might be superfluous, but I thought it would be nice to have somewhere to suggest and keep track of new code examples for crunchy.


# Examples #

## Graphics ##

### The Midpoint-Line Algorithm ###

A short introduction to the Midpoint-Line (Bresenham's) Algorithm, showing off the graphics Canvas.
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_algorithm

This would be an example of crunchy in a more pure CS setting, not strictly a python one.
## Sound ##
_no examples yet_
## Other ##
I'm about to write a short tutorial on Binomial and Fibonacci Heaps - this will be pure CS, with very little practical application...
