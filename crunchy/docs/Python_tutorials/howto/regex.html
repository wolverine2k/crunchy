<h1><a name="SECTION000200000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000200000000000000000">1 Introduction</a></h1>
<p>The <tt class="module">re</tt> module was added in Python 1.5, and
provides Perl-style regular expression patterns. Earlier versions of Python
came with the <tt class="module">regex</tt> module, which provides
Emacs-style patterns. Emacs-style patterns are slightly less readable and
don't provide as many features, so there's not much reason to use the
<tt class="module">regex</tt> module when writing new code, though you might
encounter old code that uses it.</p>
<p>Regular expressions (or REs) are essentially a tiny, highly specialized
programming language embedded inside Python and made available through the
<tt class="module">re</tt> module. Using this little language, you specify
the rules for the set of possible strings that you want to match; this set
might contain English sentences, or e-mail addresses, or TeX commands, or
anything you like. You can then ask questions such as ``Does this string
match the pattern?'', or ``Is there a match for the pattern anywhere in this
string?''. You can also use REs to modify a string or to split it apart in
various ways.</p>
<p>Regular expression patterns are compiled into a series of bytecodes which
are then executed by a matching engine written in C. For advanced use, it may
be necessary to pay careful attention to how the engine will execute a given
RE, and write the RE in a certain way in order to produce bytecode that runs
faster. Optimization isn't covered in this document, because it requires that
you have a good understanding of the matching engine's internals.</p>
<p>The regular expression language is relatively small and restricted, so not
all possible string processing tasks can be done using regular expressions.
There are also tasks that <i>can</i> be done with regular expressions, but
the expressions turn out to be very complicated. In these cases, you may be
better off writing Python code to do the processing; while Python code will
be slower than an elaborate regular expression, it will also probably be more
understandable.</p>
<h1><a name="SECTION000300000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000300000000000000000">2 Simple Patterns</a></h1>
<p>We'll start by learning about the simplest possible regular expressions.
Since regular expressions are used to operate on strings, we'll begin with
the most common task: matching characters.</p>
<p>For a detailed explanation of the computer science underlying regular
expressions (deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata), you can
refer to almost any textbook on writing compilers.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION000310000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000310000000000000000">2.1 Matching Characters</a></h2>
<p>Most letters and characters will simply match themselves. For example, the
regular expression <tt class="regexp">test</tt> will match the string
"<tt class="samp">test</tt>" exactly. (You can enable a case-insensitive mode
that would let this RE match "<tt class="samp">Test</tt>" or "<tt class=
"samp">TEST</tt>" as well; more about this later.)</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this rule; some characters are special, and don't
match themselves. Instead, they signal that some out-of-the-ordinary thing
should be matched, or they affect other portions of the RE by repeating them.
Much of this document is devoted to discussing various metacharacters and
what they do.</p>
<p>Here's a complete list of the metacharacters; their meanings will be
discussed in the rest of this HOWTO.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre>
. ^ $ * + ? { [ ] \ | ( )
</pre></div>
<p>The first metacharacters we'll look at are "<tt class="samp">[</tt>" and
"<tt class="samp">]</tt>". They're used for specifying a character class,
which is a set of characters that you wish to match. Characters can be listed
individually, or a range of characters can be indicated by giving two
characters and separating them by a "<tt class="character">-</tt>". For
example, <tt class="regexp">[abc]</tt> will match any of the characters
"<tt class="samp">a</tt>", "<tt class="samp">b</tt>", or "<tt class=
"samp">c</tt>"; this is the same as <tt class="regexp">[a-c]</tt>, which uses
a range to express the same set of characters. If you wanted to match only
lowercase letters, your RE would be <tt class="regexp">[a-z]</tt>.</p>
<p>Metacharacters are not active inside classes. For example, <tt class=
"regexp">[akm$]</tt> will match any of the characters "<tt class=
"character">a</tt>", "<tt class="character">k</tt>", "<tt class=
"character">m</tt>", or "<tt class="character">$</tt>"; "<tt class=
"character">$</tt>" is usually a metacharacter, but inside a character class
it's stripped of its special nature.</p>
<p>You can match the characters not within a range by <i class=
"dfn">complementing</i> the set. This is indicated by including a "<tt class=
"character">^</tt>" as the first character of the class; "<tt class=
"character">^</tt>" elsewhere will simply match the "<tt class=
"character">^</tt>" character. For example, <code>[^5]</code> will match any
character except "<tt class="character">5</tt>".</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important metacharacter is the backslash, "<tt class=
"samp">\</tt>". As in Python string literals, the backslash can be followed
by various characters to signal various special sequences. It's also used to
escape all the metacharacters so you can still match them in patterns; for
example, if you need to match a "<tt class="samp">[</tt>" or "<tt class=
"samp">\</tt>", you can precede them with a backslash to remove their special
meaning: <tt class="regexp">\[</tt> or <tt class="regexp">\\</tt>.</p>
<p>Some of the special sequences beginning with "<tt class=
"character">\</tt>" represent predefined sets of characters that are often
useful, such as the set of digits, the set of letters, or the set of anything
that isn't whitespace. The following predefined special sequences are
available:</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>\d</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any decimal digit; this is equivalent to the class <tt class=
"regexp">[0-9]</tt>.</dd>
<dt><code>\D</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any non-digit character; this is equivalent to the class
<code>[^0-9]</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>\s</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class
<tt class="regexp">[ \t\n\r\f\v]</tt>.</dd>
<dt><code>\S</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any non-whitespace character; this is equivalent to the class
<code>[^ \t\n\r\f\v]</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>\w</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class
<tt class="regexp">[a-zA-Z0-9_]</tt>.</dd>
<dt><code>\W</code></dt>
<dd>Matches any non-alphanumeric character; this is equivalent to the class
<code>[^a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These sequences can be included inside a character class. For example,
<tt class="regexp">[\s,.]</tt> is a character class that will match any
whitespace character, or "<tt class="character">,</tt>" or "<tt class=
"character">.</tt>".</p>
<p>The final metacharacter in this section is <tt class="regexp">.</tt>. It
matches anything except a newline character, and there's an alternate mode
(<code>re.DOTALL</code>) where it will match even a newline. "<tt class=
"character">.</tt>" is often used where you want to match ``any
character''.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION000320000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000320000000000000000">2.2 Repeating Things</a></h2>
<p>Being able to match varying sets of characters is the first thing regular
expressions can do that isn't already possible with the methods available on
strings. However, if that was the only additional capability of regexes, they
wouldn't be much of an advance. Another capability is that you can specify
that portions of the RE must be repeated a certain number of times.</p>
<p>The first metacharacter for repeating things that we'll look at is
<tt class="regexp">*</tt>. <tt class="regexp">*</tt> doesn't match the
literal character "<tt class="samp">*</tt>"; instead, it specifies that the
previous character can be matched zero or more times, instead of exactly
once.</p>
<p>For example, <tt class="regexp">ca*t</tt> will match "<tt class=
"samp">ct</tt>" (0 "<tt class="samp">a</tt>"characters), "<tt class=
"samp">cat</tt>" (1 "<tt class="samp">a</tt>"), "<tt class="samp">caaat</tt>"
(3 "<tt class="samp">a</tt>"characters), and so forth. The RE engine has
various internal limitations stemming from the size of C's <code>int</code>
type, that will prevent it from matching over 2 billion "<tt class=
"samp">a</tt>" characters; you probably don't have enough memory to construct
a string that large, so you shouldn't run into that limit.</p>
<p>Repetitions such as <tt class="regexp">*</tt> are <i class=
"dfn">greedy</i>; when repeating a RE, the matching engine will try to repeat
it as many times as possible. If later portions of the pattern don't match,
the matching engine will then back up and try again with few repetitions.</p>
<p>A step-by-step example will make this more obvious. Let's consider the
expression <tt class="regexp">a[bcd]*b</tt>. This matches the letter
"<tt class="character">a</tt>", zero or more letters from the class
<code>[bcd]</code>, and finally ends with a "<tt class="character">b</tt>".
Now imagine matching this RE against the string "<tt class=
"samp">abcbd</tt>".</p>

<td align="left"><code>abcb</code></td>
<td align="left">Back up, so that <tt class="regexp">[bcd]*</tt> matches one
less character.</td>

<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline">5</td>
<td align="left"><i>Failure</i></td>
<td align="left">Try <tt class="regexp">b</tt> again, but the current
position is at the last character, which is a "<tt class=
"character">d</tt>".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline">6</td>
<td align="left"><code>abc</code></td>
<td align="left">Back up again, so that <tt class="regexp">[bcd]*</tt> is
only matching "<tt class="samp">bc</tt>".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline">6</td>
<td align="left"><code>abcb</code></td>
<td align="left">Try <tt class="regexp">b</tt> again. This time but the
character at the current position is "<tt class="character">b</tt>", so it
succeeds.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The end of the RE has now been reached, and it has matched "<tt class=
"samp">abcb</tt>". This demonstrates how the matching engine goes as far as
it can at first, and if no match is found it will then progressively back up
and retry the rest of the RE again and again. It will back up until it has
tried zero matches for <tt class="regexp">[bcd]*</tt>, and if that
subsequently fails, the engine will conclude that the string doesn't match
the RE at all.</p>
<p>Another repeating metacharacter is <tt class="regexp">+</tt>, which
matches one or more times. Pay careful attention to the difference between
<tt class="regexp">*</tt> and <tt class="regexp">+</tt>; <tt class=
"regexp">*</tt> matches <i>zero</i> or more times, so whatever's being
repeated may not be present at all, while <tt class="regexp">+</tt> requires
at least <i>one</i> occurrence. To use a similar example, <tt class=
"regexp">ca+t</tt> will match "<tt class="samp">cat</tt>" (1 "<tt class=
"samp">a</tt>"), "<tt class="samp">caaat</tt>" (3 "<tt class=
"samp">a</tt>"'s), but won't match "<tt class="samp">ct</tt>".</p>
<p>There are two more repeating qualifiers. The question mark character,
<tt class="regexp">?</tt>, matches either once or zero times; you can think
of it as marking something as being optional. For example, <tt class=
"regexp">home-?brew</tt> matches either "<tt class="samp">homebrew</tt>" or
"<tt class="samp">home-brew</tt>".</p>
<p>The most complicated repeated qualifier is <tt class=
"regexp">{<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>}</tt>, where <var>m</var> and
<var>n</var> are decimal integers. This qualifier means there must be at
least <var>m</var> repetitions, and at most <var>n</var>. For example,
<tt class="regexp">a/{1,3}b</tt> will match "<tt class="samp">a/b</tt>",
"<tt class="samp">a//b</tt>", and "<tt class="samp">a///b</tt>". It won't
match "<tt class="samp">ab</tt>", which has no slashes, or "<tt class=
"samp">a////b</tt>", which has four.</p>
<p>You can omit either <var>m</var> or <var>n</var>; in that case, a
reasonable value is assumed for the missing value. Omitting <var>m</var> is
interpreted as a lower limit of 0, while omitting <var>n</var> results in an
upper bound of infinity -- actually, the 2 billion limit mentioned earlier,
but that might as well be infinity.</p>
<p>Readers of a reductionist bent may notice that the three other qualifiers
can all be expressed using this notation. <tt class="regexp">{0,}</tt> is the
same as <tt class="regexp">*</tt>, <tt class="regexp">{1,}</tt> is equivalent
to <tt class="regexp">+</tt>, and <tt class="regexp">{0,1}</tt> is the same
as <tt class="regexp">?</tt>. It's better to use <tt class="regexp">*</tt>,
<tt class="regexp">+</tt>, or <tt class="regexp">?</tt> when you can, simply
because they're shorter and easier to read.</p>
<h1><a name="SECTION000400000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000400000000000000000">3 Using Regular Expressions</a></h1>
<p>Now that we've looked at some simple regular expressions, how do we
actually use them in Python? The <tt class="module">re</tt> module provides
an interface to the regular expression engine, allowing you to compile REs
into objects and then perform matches with them.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION000410000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000410000000000000000">3.1 Compiling Regular Expressions</a></h2>
<p>Regular expressions are compiled into <tt class="class">RegexObject</tt>
instances, which have methods for various operations such as searching for
pattern matches or performing string substitutions.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('ab*')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p
&lt;re.RegexObject instance at 80b4150&gt;
</pre></div>
<p><tt class="function">re.compile()</tt> also accepts an optional
<var>flags</var> argument, used to enable various special features and syntax
variations. We'll go over the available settings later, but for now a single
example will do:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('ab*', re.IGNORECASE)
</pre></div>
<p>The RE is passed to <tt class="function">re.compile()</tt> as a string.
REs are handled as strings because regular expressions aren't part of the
core Python language, and no special syntax was created for expressing them.
(There are applications that don't need REs at all, so there's no need to
bloat the language specification by including them.) Instead, the <tt class=
"module">re</tt> module is simply a C extension module included with Python,
just like the <tt class="module">socket</tt> or <tt class="module">zlib</tt>
module.</p>
<p>Putting REs in strings keeps the Python language simpler, but has one
disadvantage which is the topic of the next section.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION000420000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000420000000000000000">3.2 The Backslash Plague</a></h2>
<p>As stated earlier, regular expressions use the backslash character
("<tt class="character">\</tt>") to indicate special forms or to allow
special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This
conflicts with Python's usage of the same character for the same purpose in
string literals.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to write a RE that matches the string "<tt class=
"samp">\section</tt>", which might be found in a <span class=
"logo,LaTeX">L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<small>E</small>X</span> file. To
figure out what to write in the program code, start with the desired string
to be matched. Next, you must escape any backslashes and other metacharacters
by preceding them with a backslash, resulting in the string "<tt class=
"samp">\\section</tt>". The resulting string that must be passed to
<tt class="function">re.compile()</tt> must be <code>\\section</code>.
However, to express this as a Python string literal, both backslashes must be
escaped <i>again</i>.</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;" align="center" border="1">
<thead>
<tr class="tableheader">
<th align="center"><b>Characters</b> </th>
<th align="left"><b>Stage</b> </th>
</tr>

<tbody valign="baseline">
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline"><code>\section</code></td>
<td align="left">Text string to be matched</td>

<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline"><code>\\section</code></td>
<td align="left">Escaped backslash for <tt class=

</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline"><code>"\\\\section"</code></td>
<td align="left">Escaped backslashes for a string literal</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In short, to match a literal backslash, one has to write
<code>'\\\\'</code> as the RE string, because the regular expression must be
"<tt class="samp">\\</tt>", and each backslash must be expressed as
"<tt class="samp">\\</tt>" inside a regular Python string literal. In REs
that feature backslashes repeatedly, this leads to lots of repeated
backslashes and makes the resulting strings difficult to understand.</p>
<p>The solution is to use Python's raw string notation for regular
expressions; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string
literal prefixed with "<tt class="character">r</tt>", so <code>r"\n"</code>
is a two-character string containing "<tt class="character">\</tt>" and
"<tt class="character">n</tt>", while <code>"\n"</code> is a one-character
string containing a newline. Frequently regular expressions will be expressed
in Python code using this raw string notation.</p>

<p>Once you have an object representing a compiled regular expression, what
do you do with it? <tt class="class">RegexObject</tt> instances have several
methods and attributes. Only the most significant ones will be covered here;
consult <a class="ulink" href=
"http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-re.html">the Library Reference</a> for
a complete listing.</p>

<p><tt class="method">match()</tt> and <tt class="method">search()</tt>
return <code>None</code> if no match can be found. If they're successful, a
<code>MatchObject</code> instance is returned, containing information about
the match: where it starts and ends, the substring it matched, and more.</p>
<p>You can learn about this by interactively experimenting with the
<tt class="module">re</tt> module. If you have Tkinter available, you may
also want to look at <span class="file">Tools/scripts/redemo.py</span>, a
demonstration program included with the Python distribution. It allows you to
enter REs and strings, and displays whether the RE matches or fails.
<span class="file">redemo.py</span> can be quite useful when trying to debug
a complicated RE. Phil Schwartz's <a class="ulink" href=
"http://kodos.sourceforge.net/">Kodos</a> is also an interactive tool for
developing and testing RE patterns. This HOWTO will use the standard Python
interpreter for its examples.</p>
<p>First, run the Python interpreter, import the <tt class="module">re</tt>
module, and compile a RE: </p>
<span class="vlam_comment" style=
"display: none">Crunchy comment: if you have already imported the module re
earlier, you don't need to import it again.</span>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
Python 2.2.2 (#1, Feb 10 2003, 12:57:01)
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('[a-z]+')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p
&lt;_sre.SRE_Pattern object at 80c3c28&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>Now, you can try matching various strings against the RE <tt class=
"regexp">[a-z]+</tt>. An empty string shouldn't match at all, since
<tt class="regexp">+</tt> means 'one or more repetitions'. <tt class=
"method">match()</tt> should return <code>None</code> in this case, which
will cause the interpreter to print no output. You can explicitly print the
result of <tt class="method">match()</tt> to make this clear.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.match("")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.match("")
None
</pre></div>
<p>Now, let's try it on a string that it should match, such as "<tt class=
"samp">tempo</tt>". In this case, <tt class="method">match()</tt> will return
a <tt class="class">MatchObject</tt>, so you should store the result in a
variable for later use.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.match( 'tempo')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print m
&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 80c4f68&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>Now you can query the <tt class="class">MatchObject</tt> for information
about the matching string. <tt class="class">MatchObject</tt> instances also
have several methods and attributes; the most important ones are:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse;" align="center" border="1">
<thead>
<tr class="tableheader">
<th align="center"><b>Method/Attribute</b> </th>
<th align="left"><b>Purpose</b> </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="baseline">
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline"><code>group()</code></td>
<td align="left">Return the string matched by the RE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline"><code>start()</code></td>
<td align="left">Return the starting position of the match</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline"><code>end()</code></td>
<td align="left">Return the ending position of the match</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="baseline"><code>span()</code></td>
<td align="left">Return a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the
match</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Trying these methods will soon clarify their meaning:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group()
'tempo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.start(), m.end()
(0, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.span()
(0, 5)
</pre></div>
<p><tt class="method">group()</tt> returns the substring that was matched by
the RE. <tt class="method">start()</tt> and <tt class="method">end()</tt>
return the starting and ending index of the match. <tt class=
"method">span()</tt> returns both start and end indexes in a single tuple.
Since the <tt class="method">match</tt> method only checks if the RE matches
at the start of a string, <tt class="method">start()</tt> will always be
zero. However, the <tt class="method">search</tt> method of <tt class=
"class">RegexObject</tt> instances scans through the string, so the match may
not start at zero in that case.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.match('::: message')
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.search('::: message') ; print m
&lt;re.MatchObject instance at 80c9650&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group()
'message'
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.span()
(4, 11)
</pre></div>
<p>In actual programs, the most common style is to store the <tt class=
"class">MatchObject</tt> in a variable, and then check if it was
<code>None</code>. This usually looks like:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre>
p = re.compile( ... )
m = p.match( 'string goes here' )
if m:
    print 'Match found: ', m.group()
else:
    print 'No match'
</pre></div>
<p>Two <tt class="class">RegexObject</tt> methods return all of the matches
for a pattern. <tt class="method">findall()</tt> returns a list of matching
strings:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('\d+')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.findall('12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping')
['12', '11', '10']
</pre></div>
<p><tt class="method">findall()</tt> has to create the entire list before it
can be returned as the result. In Python 2.2, the <tt class=
"method">finditer()</tt> method is also available, returning a sequence of
<tt class="class">MatchObject</tt> instances as an iterator.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; iterator = p.finditer('12 drummers drumming, 11 ... 10 ...')
&gt;&gt;&gt; iterator
&lt;callable-iterator object at 0x401833ac&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for match in iterator:
...     print match.span()
...

<h2><a name="SECTION000440000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000440000000000000000">3.4 Module-Level Functions</a></h2>
<p>You don't have to produce a <tt class="class">RegexObject</tt> and call
its methods; the <tt class="module">re</tt> module also provides top-level
functions called <tt class="function">match()</tt>, <tt class=
"function">search()</tt>, <tt class="function">sub()</tt>, and so forth.
These functions take the same arguments as the corresponding <tt class=
"class">RegexObject</tt> method, with the RE string added as the first
argument, and still return either <code>None</code> or a <tt class=
"class">MatchObject</tt> instance.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match(r'From\s+', 'Fromage amk')
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(r'From\s+', 'From amk Thu May 14 19:12:10 1998')
&lt;re.MatchObject instance at 80c5978&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>Under the hood, these functions simply produce a <tt class=
"class">RegexObject</tt> for you and call the appropriate method on it. They
also store the compiled object in a cache, so future calls using the same RE
are faster.</p>
<p>Should you use these module-level functions, or should you get the
<tt class="class">RegexObject</tt> and call its methods yourself? That choice
depends on how frequently the RE will be used, and on your personal coding
style. If a RE is being used at only one point in the code, then the module
functions are probably more convenient. If a program contains a lot of
regular expressions, or re-uses the same ones in several locations, then it
might be worthwhile to collect all the definitions in one place, in a section
of code that compiles all the REs ahead of time. To take an example from the
standard library, here's an extract from <span class=
"file">xmllib.py</span>:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
ref = re.compile( ... )
entityref = re.compile( ... )
charref = re.compile( ... )
starttagopen = re.compile( ... )
</pre></div>
<p>I generally prefer to work with the compiled object, even for one-time
uses, but few people will be as much of a purist about this as I am.</p>

"SECTION000450000000000000000">3.5 Compilation Flags</a></h2>
<p>Compilation flags let you modify some aspects of how regular expressions
work. Flags are available in the <tt class="module">re</tt> module under two
names, a long name such as <tt class="constant">IGNORECASE</tt>, and a short,
one-letter form such as <tt class="constant">I</tt>. (If you're familiar with
Perl's pattern modifiers, the one-letter forms use the same letters; the
short form of <tt class="constant">re.VERBOSE</tt> is <tt class=
"constant">re.X</tt>, for example.) Multiple flags can be specified by
bitwise OR-ing them; <code>re.I | re.M</code> sets both the <tt class=
"constant">I</tt> and <tt class="constant">M</tt> flags, for example.</p>
<p>Here's a table of the available flags, followed by a more detailed

the character class <tt class="regexp">[A-Za-z]</tt>; it won't match "" or
"". If your system is configured properly and a French locale is selected,
certain C functions will tell the program that "" should also be considered a
letter. Setting the <tt class="constant">LOCALE</tt> flag when compiling a
regular expression will cause the resulting compiled object to use these C
functions for <tt class="regexp">\w</tt>; this is slower, but also enables
<tt class="regexp">\w+</tt> to match French words as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Usually <tt class="regexp">^</tt> matches only at the beginning of the

following each newline. Similarly, the <tt class="regexp">$</tt>
metacharacter matches either at the end of the string and at the end of each
line (immediately preceding each newline).</p>

<dt><b><a name="l2h-10" id="l2h-10"><tt>VERBOSE</tt></a></b></dt>
<dd>This flag allows you to write regular expressions that are more readable
by granting you more flexibility in how you can format them. When this flag
has been specified, whitespace within the RE string is ignored, except when
the whitespace is in a character class or preceded by an unescaped backslash;
this lets you organize and indent the RE more clearly. It also enables you to
put comments within a RE that will be ignored by the engine; comments are
marked by a "<tt class="character">#</tt>" that's neither in a character
class or preceded by an unescaped backslash.
<p>For example, here's a RE that uses <tt class="constant">re.VERBOSE</tt>;
see how much easier it is to read?</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre>
charref = re.compile(r"""
 &amp;[#]           # Start of a numeric entity reference
 (
   [0-9]+[^0-9]      # Decimal form
   | 0[0-7]+[^0-7]   # Octal form
   | x[0-9a-fA-F]+[^0-9a-fA-F] # Hexadecimal form
 )
""", re.VERBOSE)
</pre></div>
<p>Without the verbose setting, the RE would look like this:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre>
charref = re.compile("&amp;#([0-9]+[^0-9]"
                     "|0[0-7]+[^0-7]"
                     "|x[0-9a-fA-F]+[^0-9a-fA-F])")
</pre></div>
<p>In the above example, Python's automatic concatenation of string literals
has been used to break up the RE into smaller pieces, but it's still more
difficult to understand than the version using <tt class=
"constant">re.VERBOSE</tt>.</p>

4.1 More Metacharacters</h2>
<p>There are some metacharacters that we haven't covered yet. Most of them
will be covered in this section.</p>
<p>Some of the remaining metacharacters to be discussed are <i class=
"dfn">zero-width assertions</i>. They don't cause the engine to advance
through the string; instead, they consume no characters at all, and simply
succeed or fail. For example, <tt class="regexp">\b</tt> is an assertion that
the current position is located at a word boundary; the position isn't
changed by the <tt class="regexp">\b</tt> at all. This means that zero-width
assertions should never be repeated, because if they match once at a given
location, they can obviously be matched an infinite number of times.</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><tt class="regexp">|</tt></dt>
<dd>Alternation, or the ``or'' operator. If A and B are regular expressions,
<tt class="regexp">A|B</tt> will match any string that matches either
"<tt class="samp">A</tt>" or "<tt class="samp">B</tt>". <tt class=
"regexp">|</tt> has very low precedence in order to make it work reasonably
when you're alternating multi-character strings. <tt class=
"regexp">Crow|Servo</tt> will match either "<tt class="samp">Crow</tt>" or
"<tt class="samp">Servo</tt>", not "<tt class="samp">Cro</tt>", a "<tt class=
"character">w</tt>" or an "<tt class="character">S</tt>", and "<tt class=
"samp">ervo</tt>".
<p>To match a literal "<tt class="character">|</tt>", use <tt class=
"regexp">\|</tt>, or enclose it inside a character class, as in <tt class=
"regexp">[|]</tt>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="regexp">^</tt></dt>
<dd>Matches at the beginning of lines. Unless the <tt class=
"constant">MULTILINE</tt> flag has been set, this will only match at the
beginning of the string. In <tt class="constant">MULTILINE</tt> mode, this
also matches immediately after each newline within the string.
<p>For example, if you wish to match the word "<tt class="samp">From</tt>"
only at the beginning of a line, the RE to use is <code>^From</code>.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('^From', 'From Here to Eternity')
&lt;re.MatchObject instance at 80c1520&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('^From', 'Reciting From Memory')
None
</pre></div>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="regexp">$</tt></dt>
<dd>Matches at the end of a line, which is defined as either the end of the
string, or any location followed by a newline character.
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('}$', '{block}')
&lt;re.MatchObject instance at 80adfa8&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('}$', '{block} ')
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('}$', '{block}\n')
&lt;re.MatchObject instance at 80adfa8&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>To match a literal "<tt class="character">$</tt>", use <tt class=
"regexp">\$</tt> or enclose it inside a character class, as in <tt class=
"regexp">[$]</tt>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="regexp">\A</tt></dt>
<dd>Matches only at the start of the string. When not in <tt class=
"constant">MULTILINE</tt> mode, <tt class="regexp">\A</tt> and <tt class=
"regexp">^</tt> are effectively the same. In <tt class=
"constant">MULTILINE</tt> mode, however, they're different; <tt class=
"regexp">\A</tt> still matches only at the beginning of the string, but
<tt class="regexp">^</tt> may match at any location inside the string that
follows a newline character.</dd>
<dt><tt class="regexp">\Z</tt></dt>
<dd>Matches only at the end of the string.</dd>
<dt><tt class="regexp">\b</tt></dt>
<dd>Word boundary. This is a zero-width assertion that matches only at the
beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of alphanumeric
characters, so the end of a word is indicated by whitespace or a
non-alphanumeric character.
<p>The following example matches "<tt class="samp">class</tt>" only when it's
a complete word; it won't match when it's contained inside another word.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'\bclass\b')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('no class at all')
&lt;re.MatchObject instance at 80c8f28&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('the declassified algorithm')
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('one subclass is')
None
</pre></div>
<p>There are two subtleties you should remember when using this special
sequence. First, this is the worst collision between Python's string literals
and regular expression sequences. In Python's string literals, "<tt class=
"samp">\b</tt>" is the backspace character, ASCII value 8. If you're not
using raw strings, then Python will convert the "<tt class="samp">\b</tt>" to
a backspace, and your RE won't match as you expect it to. The following
example looks the same as our previous RE, but omits the "<tt class=
"character">r</tt>" in front of the RE string.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('\bclass\b')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('no class at all')
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.search('\b' + 'class' + '\b')  
&lt;re.MatchObject instance at 80c3ee0&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>Second, inside a character class, where there's no use for this assertion,
<tt class="regexp">\b</tt> represents the backspace character, for
compatibility with Python's string literals.</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="regexp">\B</tt></dt>
<dd>Another zero-width assertion, this is the opposite of <tt class=
"regexp">\b</tt>, only matching when the current position is not at a word
boundary.</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="SECTION000520000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000520000000000000000">4.2 Grouping</a></h2>
<p>Frequently you need to obtain more information than just whether the RE
matched or not. Regular expressions are often used to dissect strings by
writing a RE divided into several subgroups which match different components
of interest. For example, an RFC-822 header line is divided into a header
name and a value, separated by a "<tt class="character">:</tt>". This can be
handled by writing a regular expression which matches an entire header line,
and has one group which matches the header name, and another group which
matches the header's value.</p>
<p>Groups are marked by the "<tt class="character">(</tt>", "<tt class=
"character">)</tt>" metacharacters. "<tt class="character">(</tt>" and
"<tt class="character">)</tt>" have much the same meaning as they do in
mathematical expressions; they group together the expressions contained
inside them. For example, you can repeat the contents of a group with a
repeating qualifier, such as <tt class="regexp">*</tt>, <tt class=
"regexp">+</tt>, <tt class="regexp">?</tt>, or <tt class=
"regexp">{<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>}</tt>. For example, <tt class=
"regexp">(ab)*</tt> will match zero or more repetitions of "<tt class=
"samp">ab</tt>".</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('(ab)*')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.match('ababababab').span()

<p>Groups indicated with "<tt class="character">(</tt>", "<tt class=
"character">)</tt>" also capture the starting and ending index of the text
that they match; this can be retrieved by passing an argument to <tt class=
"method">group()</tt>, <tt class="method">start()</tt>, <tt class=
"method">end()</tt>, and <tt class="method">span()</tt>. Groups are numbered
starting with 0. Group 0 is always present; it's the whole RE, so <tt class=
"class">MatchObject</tt> methods all have group 0 as their default argument.
Later we'll see how to express groups that don't capture the span of text
that they match.</p>
<div class="verbatim">

<p>Subgroups are numbered from left to right, from 1 upward. Groups can be
nested; to determine the number, just count the opening parenthesis

&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('(a(b)c)d')
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.match('abcd')
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(0)
'abcd'
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1)
'abc'
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(2)
'b'
</pre></div>
<p><tt class="method">group()</tt> can be passed multiple group numbers at a
time, in which case it will return a tuple containing the corresponding
values for those groups.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
  
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(2,1,2)
('b', 'abc', 'b')
</pre></div>
<p>The <tt class="method">groups()</tt> method returns a tuple containing the
strings for all the subgroups, from 1 up to however many there are.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
  
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups()
('abc', 'b')
</pre></div>
<p>Backreferences in a pattern allow you to specify that the contents of an
earlier capturing group must also be found at the current location in the
string. For example, <tt class="regexp">\1</tt> will succeed if the exact
contents of group 1 can be found at the current position, and fails
otherwise. Remember that Python's string literals also use a backslash
followed by numbers to allow including arbitrary characters in a string, so
be sure to use a raw string when incorporating backreferences in a RE.</p>
<p>For example, the following RE detects doubled words in a string.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'(\b\w+)\s+\1')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.search('Paris in the the spring').group()
'the the'
</pre></div>
<p>Backreferences like this aren't often useful for just searching through a
string -- there are few text formats which repeat data in this way -- but
you'll soon find out that they're <i>very</i> useful when performing string
substitutions.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION000530000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000530000000000000000">4.3 Non-capturing and Named Groups</a></h2>
<p>Elaborate REs may use many groups, both to capture substrings of interest,
and to group and structure the RE itself. In complex REs, it becomes
difficult to keep track of the group numbers. There are two features which
help with this problem. Both of them use a common syntax for regular
expression extensions, so we'll look at that first.</p>
<p>Perl 5 added several additional features to standard regular expressions,
and the Python <tt class="module">re</tt> module supports most of them. It
would have been difficult to choose new single-keystroke metacharacters or
new special sequences beginning with "<tt class="samp">\</tt>" to represent
the new features without making Perl's regular expressions confusingly
different from standard REs. If you chose "<tt class="samp">&amp;</tt>" as a
new metacharacter, for example, old expressions would be assuming that
"<tt class="samp">&amp;</tt>" was a regular character and wouldn't have
escaped it by writing <tt class="regexp">\&amp;</tt> or <tt class=
"regexp">[&amp;]</tt>.</p>
<p>The solution chosen by the Perl developers was to use <tt class=
"regexp">(?...)</tt> as the extension syntax. "<tt class="samp">?</tt>"
immediately after a parenthesis was a syntax error because the "<tt class=
"samp">?</tt>" would have nothing to repeat, so this didn't introduce any
compatibility problems. The characters immediately after the "<tt class=
"samp">?</tt>" indicate what extension is being used, so <tt class=
"regexp">(?=foo)</tt> is one thing (a positive lookahead assertion) and
<tt class="regexp">(?:foo)</tt> is something else (a non-capturing group
containing the subexpression <tt class="regexp">foo</tt>).</p>
<p>Python adds an extension syntax to Perl's extension syntax. If the first
character after the question mark is a "<tt class="samp">P</tt>", you know
that it's an extension that's specific to Python. Currently there are two
such extensions: <tt class="regexp">(?P&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;...)</tt>
defines a named group, and <tt class="regexp">(?P=<var>name</var>)</tt> is a
backreference to a named group. If future versions of Perl 5 add similar
features using a different syntax, the <tt class="module">re</tt> module will
be changed to support the new syntax, while preserving the Python-specific
syntax for compatibility's sake.</p>
<p>Now that we've looked at the general extension syntax, we can return to
the features that simplify working with groups in complex REs. Since groups
are numbered from left to right and a complex expression may use many groups,
it can become difficult to keep track of the correct numbering, and modifying
such a complex RE is annoying. Insert a new group near the beginning, and you
change the numbers of everything that follows it.</p>
<p>First, sometimes you'll want to use a group to collect a part of a regular
expression, but aren't interested in retrieving the group's contents. You can
make this fact explicit by using a non-capturing group: <tt class=
"regexp">(?:...)</tt>, where you can put any other regular expression inside
the parentheses.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match("([abc])+", "abc")
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups()
('c',)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.match("(?:[abc])+", "abc")
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.groups()
()
</pre></div>
<p>Except for the fact that you can't retrieve the contents of what the group
matched, a non-capturing group behaves exactly the same as a capturing group;
you can put anything inside it, repeat it with a repetition metacharacter
such as "<tt class="samp">*</tt>", and nest it within other groups (capturing
or non-capturing). <tt class="regexp">(?:...)</tt> is particularly useful
when modifying an existing group, since you can add new groups without
changing how all the other groups are numbered. It should be mentioned that
there's no performance difference in searching between capturing and
non-capturing groups; neither form is any faster than the other.</p>
<p>The second, and more significant, feature is named groups; instead of
referring to them by numbers, groups can be referenced by a name.</p>
<p>The syntax for a named group is one of the Python-specific extensions:
<tt class="regexp">(?P&lt;<var>name</var>&gt;...)</tt>. <var>name</var> is,
obviously, the name of the group. Except for associating a name with a group,
named groups also behave identically to capturing groups. The <tt class=
"class">MatchObject</tt> methods that deal with capturing groups all accept
either integers, to refer to groups by number, or a string containing the
group name. Named groups are still given numbers, so you can retrieve
information about a group in two ways:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;word&gt;\b\w+\b)')
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = p.search( '(((( Lots of punctuation )))' )
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group('word')
'Lots'
&gt;&gt;&gt; m.group(1)
'Lots'
</pre></div>
<p>Named groups are handy because they let you use easily-remembered names,
instead of having to remember numbers. Here's an example RE from the
<tt class="module">imaplib</tt> module:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre>
InternalDate = re.compile(r'INTERNALDATE "'
        r'(?P&lt;day&gt;[ 123][0-9])-(?P&lt;mon&gt;[A-Z][a-z][a-z])-'
   r'(?P&lt;year&gt;[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])'
        r' (?P&lt;hour&gt;[0-9][0-9]):(?P&lt;min&gt;[0-9][0-9]):(?P&lt;sec&gt;[0-9][0-9])'
        r' (?P&lt;zonen&gt;[-+])(?P&lt;zoneh&gt;[0-9][0-9])(?P&lt;zonem&gt;[0-9][0-9])'
        r'"')
</pre></div>
<p>It's obviously much easier to retrieve <code>m.group('zonem')</code>,
instead of having to remember to retrieve group 9.</p>
<p>Since the syntax for backreferences, in an expression like <tt class=
"regexp">(...)\1</tt>, refers to the number of the group there's naturally a
variant that uses the group name instead of the number. This is also a Python
extension: <tt class="regexp">(?P=<var>name</var>)</tt> indicates that the
contents of the group called <var>name</var> should again be found at the
current point. The regular expression for finding doubled words, <tt class=
"regexp">(\b\w+)\s+\1</tt> can also be written as <tt class=
"regexp">(?P&lt;word&gt;\b\w+)\s+(?P=word)</tt>:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'(?P&lt;word&gt;\b\w+)\s+(?P=word)')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.search('Paris in the the spring').group()
'the the'
</pre></div>
<h2><a name="SECTION000540000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000540000000000000000">4.4 Lookahead Assertions</a></h2>
<p>Another zero-width assertion is the lookahead assertion. Lookahead
assertions are available in both positive and negative form, and look like
this:</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><tt class="regexp">(?=...)</tt></dt>
<dd>Positive lookahead assertion. This succeeds if the contained regular
expression, represented here by <code>...</code>, successfully matches at the
current location, and fails otherwise. But, once the contained expression has
been tried, the matching engine doesn't advance at all; the rest of the
pattern is tried right where the assertion started.</dd>
<dt><tt class="regexp">(?!...)</tt></dt>
<dd>Negative lookahead assertion. This is the opposite of the positive
assertion; it succeeds if the contained expression <i>doesn't</i> match at
the current position in the string.</dd>
</dl>
<p>An example will help make this concrete by demonstrating a case where a
lookahead is useful. Consider a simple pattern to match a filename and split
it apart into a base name and an extension, separated by a "<tt class=
"samp">.</tt>". For example, in "<tt class="samp">news.rc</tt>", "<tt class=
"samp">news</tt>"is the base name, and "<tt class="samp">rc</tt>" is the
filename's extension.</p>
<p>The pattern to match this is quite simple:</p>
<p><tt class="regexp">.*[.].*$</tt></p>
<p>Notice that the "<tt class="samp">.</tt>" needs to be treated specially
because it's a metacharacter; I've put it inside a character class. Also
notice the trailing <tt class="regexp">$</tt>; this is added to ensure that
all the rest of the string must be included in the extension. This regular
expression matches "<tt class="samp">foo.bar</tt>" and "<tt class=
"samp">autoexec.bat</tt>" and "<tt class="samp">sendmail.cf</tt>" and
"<tt class="samp">printers.conf</tt>".</p>
<p>Now, consider complicating the problem a bit; what if you want to match
filenames where the extension is not "<tt class="samp">bat</tt>"? Some
incorrect attempts:</p>
<p><code>.*[.][^b].*$</code></p>
<p>The first attempt above tries to exclude "<tt class="samp">bat</tt>" by
requiring that the first character of the extension is not a "<tt class=
"samp">b</tt>". This is wrong, because the pattern also doesn't match
"<tt class="samp">foo.bar</tt>".</p>
<p><tt class="regexp">.*[.]([^b]..|.[^a].|..[^t])$</tt></p>
<p>The expression gets messier when you try to patch up the first solution by
requiring one of the following cases to match: the first character of the
extension isn't "<tt class="samp">b</tt>"; the second character isn't
"<tt class="samp">a</tt>"; or the third character isn't "<tt class=
"samp">t</tt>". This accepts "<tt class="samp">foo.bar</tt>" and rejects
"<tt class="samp">autoexec.bat</tt>", but it requires a three-letter
extension and won't accept a filename with a two-letter extension such as
"<tt class="samp">sendmail.cf</tt>". We'll complicate the pattern again in an
effort to fix it.</p>
<p><tt class="regexp">.*[.]([^b].?.?|.[^a]?.?|..?[^t]?)$</tt></p>
<p>In the third attempt, the second and third letters are all made optional
in order to allow matching extensions shorter than three characters, such as
"<tt class="samp">sendmail.cf</tt>".</p>
<p>The pattern's getting really complicated now, which makes it hard to read
and understand. Worse, if the problem changes and you want to exclude both
"<tt class="samp">bat</tt>" and "<tt class="samp">exe</tt>" as extensions,
the pattern would get even more complicated and confusing.</p>
<p>A negative lookahead cuts through all this:</p>
<p><tt class="regexp">.*[.](?!bat$).*$</tt></p>
<p>The lookahead means: if the expression <tt class="regexp">bat</tt> doesn't
match at this point, try the rest of the pattern; if <tt class=
"regexp">bat$</tt> does match, the whole pattern will fail. The trailing
<tt class="regexp">$</tt> is required to ensure that something like
"<tt class="samp">sample.batch</tt>", where the extension only starts with
"<tt class="samp">bat</tt>", will be allowed.</p>
<p>Excluding another filename extension is now easy; simply add it as an
alternative inside the assertion. The following pattern excludes filenames
that end in either "<tt class="samp">bat</tt>" or "<tt class=
"samp">exe</tt>":</p>
<p><tt class="regexp">.*[.](?!bat$|exe$).*$</tt></p>

occurrences to be replaced; <var>count</var> must be a non-negative integer.
The default value of 0 means to replace all occurrences.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here's a simple example of using the <tt class="method">sub()</tt> method.
It replaces colour names with the word "<tt class="samp">colour</tt>":</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile( '(blue|white|red)')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub( 'colour', 'blue socks and red shoes')
'colour socks and colour shoes'
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub( 'colour', 'blue socks and red shoes', count=1)
'colour socks and red shoes'
</pre></div>
<p>The <tt class="method">subn()</tt> method does the same work, but returns
a 2-tuple containing the new string value and the number of replacements that
were performed:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile( '(blue|white|red)')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.subn( 'colour', 'blue socks and red shoes')
('colour socks and colour shoes', 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.subn( 'colour', 'no colours at all')
('no colours at all', 0)
</pre></div>
<p>Empty matches are replaced only when they're not adjacent to a previous
match.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('x*')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub('-', 'abxd')
'-a-b-d-'
</pre></div>
<p>If <var>replacement</var> is a string, any backslash escapes in it are
processed. That is, "<tt class="samp">\n</tt>" is converted to a single
newline character, "<tt class="samp">\r</tt>" is converted to a carriage
return, and so forth. Unknown escapes such as "<tt class="samp">\j</tt>" are
left alone. Backreferences, such as "<tt class="samp">\6</tt>", are replaced
with the substring matched by the corresponding group in the RE. This lets
you incorporate portions of the original text in the resulting replacement
string.</p>
<p>This example matches the word "<tt class="samp">section</tt>" followed by
a string enclosed in "<tt class="samp">{</tt>", "<tt class="samp">}</tt>",
and changes "<tt class="samp">section</tt>" to "<tt class=
"samp">subsection</tt>":</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('section{ ( [^}]* ) }', re.VERBOSE)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(r'subsection{\1}','section{First} section{second}')
'subsection{First} subsection{second}'
</pre></div>
<p>There's also a syntax for referring to named groups as defined by the
<tt class="regexp">(?P&lt;name&gt;...)</tt> syntax. "<tt class=
"samp">\g&lt;name&gt;</tt>" will use the substring matched by the group named
"<tt class="samp">name</tt>", and "<tt class=
"samp">\g&lt;<var>number</var>&gt;</tt>" uses the corresponding group number.
"<tt class="samp">\g&lt;2&gt;</tt>" is therefore equivalent to "<tt class=
"samp">\2</tt>", but isn't ambiguous in a replacement string such as
"<tt class="samp">\g&lt;2&gt;0</tt>". ("<tt class="samp">\20</tt>" would be
interpreted as a reference to group 20, not a reference to group 2 followed
by the literal character "<tt class="character">0</tt>".) The following
substitutions are all equivalent, but use all three variations of the
replacement string.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile('section{ (?P&lt;name&gt; [^}]* ) }', re.VERBOSE)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(r'subsection{\1}','section{First}')
'subsection{First}'
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(r'subsection{\g&lt;1&gt;}','section{First}')
'subsection{First}'
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(r'subsection{\g&lt;name&gt;}','section{First}')
'subsection{First}'
</pre></div>
<p><var>replacement</var> can also be a function, which gives you even more
control. If <var>replacement</var> is a function, the function is called for
every non-overlapping occurrence of <var>pattern</var>. On each call, the
function is passed a <tt class="class">MatchObject</tt> argument for the
match and can use this information to compute the desired replacement string
and return it.</p>
<p>In the following example, the replacement function translates decimals
into hexadecimal:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; def hexrepl( match ):
...     "Return the hex string for a decimal number"
...     value = int( match.group() )
...     return hex(value)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = re.compile(r'\d+')
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.sub(hexrepl, 'Call 65490 for printing, 49152 for user code.')
'Call 0xffd2 for printing, 0xc000 for user code.'
</pre></div>
<p>When using the module-level <tt class="function">re.sub()</tt> function,
the pattern is passed as the first argument. The pattern may be a string or a
<tt class="class">RegexObject</tt>; if you need to specify regular expression
flags, you must either use a <tt class="class">RegexObject</tt> as the first
parameter, or use embedded modifiers in the pattern, e.g. <code>sub("(?i)b+",
"x", "bbbb BBBB")</code> returns <code>'x x'</code>.</p>

"SECTION000710000000000000000">6.1 Use String Methods</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes using the <tt class="module">re</tt> module is a mistake. If
you're matching a fixed string, or a single character class, and you're not
using any <tt class="module">re</tt> features such as the <tt class=
"constant">IGNORECASE</tt> flag, then the full power of regular expressions
may not be required. Strings have several methods for performing operations
with fixed strings and they're usually much faster, because the
implementation is a single small C loop that's been optimized for the
purpose, instead of the large, more generalized regular expression
engine.</p>
<p>One example might be replacing a single fixed string with another one; for
example, you might replace "<tt class="samp">word</tt>"with "<tt class=
"samp">deed</tt>". <code>re.sub()</code> seems like the function to use for
this, but consider the <tt class="method">replace()</tt> method. Note that
<tt class="function">replace()</tt> will also replace "<tt class=
"samp">word</tt>" inside words, turning "<tt class="samp">swordfish</tt>"
into "<tt class="samp">sdeedfish</tt>", but the nave RE <tt class=
"regexp">word</tt> would have done that, too. (To avoid performing the
substitution on parts of words, the pattern would have to be <tt class=
"regexp">\bword\b</tt>, in order to require that "<tt class="samp">word</tt>"
have a word boundary on either side. This takes the job beyond <tt class=
"method">replace</tt>'s abilities.)</p>
<p>Another common task is deleting every occurrence of a single character
from a string or replacing it with another single character. You might do
this with something like <code>re.sub('\n', ' ', S)</code>, but <tt class=
"method">translate()</tt> is capable of doing both tasks and will be faster
that any regular expression operation can be.</p>
<p>In short, before turning to the <tt class="module">re</tt> module,
consider whether your problem can be solved with a faster and simpler string
method.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION000720000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000720000000000000000">6.2 match() versus search()</a></h2>
<p>The <tt class="function">match()</tt> function only checks if the RE
matches at the beginning of the string while <tt class=
"function">search()</tt> will scan forward through the string for a match.
It's important to keep this distinction in mind. Remember, <tt class=
"function">match()</tt> will only report a successful match which will start
at 0; if the match wouldn't start at zero, <tt class="function">match()</tt>
will <i>not</i> report it.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('super', 'superstition').span()  
(0, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('super', 'insuperable')    
None
</pre></div>
<p>On the other hand, <tt class="function">search()</tt> will scan forward
through the string, reporting the first match it finds.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('super', 'superstition').span()
(0, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.search('super', 'insuperable').span()
(2, 7)
</pre></div>
<p>Sometimes you'll be tempted to keep using <tt class=
"function">re.match()</tt>, and just add <tt class="regexp">.*</tt> to the
front of your RE. Resist this temptation and use <tt class=
"function">re.search()</tt> instead. The regular expression compiler does
some analysis of REs in order to speed up the process of looking for a match.
One such analysis figures out what the first character of a match must be;
for example, a pattern starting with <tt class="regexp">Crow</tt> must match
starting with a "<tt class="character">C</tt>". The analysis lets the engine
quickly scan through the string looking for the starting character, only
trying the full match if a "<tt class="character">C</tt>" is found.</p>
<p>Adding <tt class="regexp">.*</tt> defeats this optimization, requiring
scanning to the end of the string and then backtracking to find a match for
the rest of the RE. Use <tt class="function">re.search()</tt> instead.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION000730000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000730000000000000000">6.3 Greedy versus Non-Greedy</a></h2>
<p>When repeating a regular expression, as in <tt class="regexp">a*</tt>, the
resulting action is to consume as much of the pattern as possible. This fact
often bites you when you're trying to match a pair of balanced delimiters,
such as the angle brackets surrounding an HTML tag. The nave pattern for
matching a single HTML tag doesn't work because of the greedy nature of
<tt class="regexp">.*</tt>.</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;'
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(s)
32
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('&lt;.*&gt;', s).span()
(0, 32)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('&lt;.*&gt;', s).group()
&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>The RE matches the "<tt class="character">&lt;</tt>" in "<tt class=
"samp">&lt;html&gt;</tt>", and the <tt class="regexp">.*</tt> consumes the
rest of the string. There's still more left in the RE, though, and the
<tt class="regexp">&gt;</tt> can't match at the end of the string, so the
regular expression engine has to backtrack character by character until it
finds a match for the <tt class="regexp">&gt;</tt>. The final match extends
from the "<tt class="character">&lt;</tt>" in "<tt class=
"samp">&lt;html&gt;</tt>"to the "<tt class="character">&gt;</tt>" in
"<tt class="samp">&lt;/title&gt;</tt>", which isn't what you want.</p>
<p>In this case, the solution is to use the non-greedy qualifiers <tt class=
"regexp">*?</tt>, <tt class="regexp">+?</tt>, <tt class="regexp">??</tt>, or
<tt class="regexp">{<var>m</var>,<var>n</var>}?</tt>, which match as
<i>little</i> text as possible. In the above example, the "<tt class=
"character">&gt;</tt>" is tried immediately after the first "<tt class=
"character">&lt;</tt>" matches, and when it fails, the engine advances a
character at a time, retrying the "<tt class="character">&gt;</tt>" at every
step. This produces just the right result:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre title="interpreter">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print re.match('&lt;.*?&gt;', s).group()
&lt;html&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>(Note that parsing HTML or XML with regular expressions is painful.
Quick-and-dirty patterns will handle common cases, but HTML and XML have
special cases that will break the obvious regular expression; by the time
you've written a regular expression that handles all of the possible cases,
the patterns will be <i>very</i> complicated. Use an HTML or XML parser
module for such tasks.)</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION000740000000000000000" id=
"SECTION000740000000000000000">6.4 Not Using re.VERBOSE</a></h2>
<p>By now you've probably noticed that regular expressions are a very compact
notation, but they're not terribly readable. REs of moderate complexity can
become lengthy collections of backslashes, parentheses, and metacharacters,
making them difficult to read and understand.</p>
<p>For such REs, specifying the <code>re.VERBOSE</code> flag when compiling
the regular expression can be helpful, because it allows you to format the
regular expression more clearly.</p>
<p>The <code>re.VERBOSE</code> flag has several effects. Whitespace in the
regular expression that <i>isn't</i> inside a character class is ignored.
This means that an expression such as <tt class="regexp">dog | cat</tt> is
equivalent to the less readable <tt class="regexp">dog|cat</tt>, but
<tt class="regexp">[a b]</tt> will still match the characters "<tt class=
"character">a</tt>", "<tt class="character">b</tt>", or a space. In addition,
you can also put comments inside a RE; comments extend from a "<tt class=
"samp">#</tt>" character to the next newline. When used with triple-quoted
strings, this enables REs to be formatted more neatly:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre>
pat = re.compile(r"""
 \s*                 # Skip leading whitespace
 (?P&lt;header&gt;[^:]+)   # Header name
 \s* :               # Whitespace, and a colon
 (?P&lt;value&gt;.*?)      # The header's value -- *? used to
                     # lose the following trailing whitespace
 \s*$                # Trailing whitespace to end-of-line
""", re.VERBOSE)
</pre></div>
<p>This is far more readable than:</p>
<div class="verbatim">
<pre>
pat = re.compile(r"\s*(?P&lt;header&gt;[^:]+)\s*:(?P&lt;value&gt;.*?)\s*$")
</pre></div>
