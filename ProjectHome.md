Crunchy is an application that formats and delivers html-written Python tutorials inside a browser window, adding interactive elements and snazzy navigation.

To get started with Crunchy, download the code and launch Crunchy by typing **python crunchy.py** in a terminal window (or by double-clicking on the crunchy.py icon).

There are now a few [screencasts](http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1430000&fromSeriesID=143) of an **older version** of Crunchy.  They been recorded as "live" sessions and, as such, are not very polished but do give an overview of Crunchy's capabilities.

It is possible to launch processes **from** Crunchy using a different Python version than the default.  For example, suppose you have Python 2.5 and Python 3.1 installed on your system.  You can start Crunchy using Python 2.5 and, from within Crunchy/Firefox, execute some code (as an external process) using Python 3.1.  Some examples are provided in the Tests section.
